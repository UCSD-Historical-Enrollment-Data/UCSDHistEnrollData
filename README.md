  <b>UCSDHistEnrollmentData</b>
</p>

A repository that branches out to multiple children repositories containing enrollment data for multiple terms at UC San Diego.

## Data
The following are terms that I've been collecting data for, along with links to their corresponding repositories.

| Term | Information | Data Collected | Link |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ---- |
| SP22 | Spring 2022 Enrollment Data | CSE, COGS, MATH, ECE undergraduate courses | [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/2022Spring) |
| SP22D | Spring 2022 Drop Data | CSE, COGS, MATH, ECE undergraduate courses | [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/2022SpringDrop) |
| S122 | Summer I 2022 Enrollment Data | CSE, COGS, MATH, ECE undergraduate courses | [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/2022Summer1) |
| S122D | Summer I 2022 Drop Data | CSE, COGS, MATH, ECE undergraduate courses | [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/2022Summer1Drop) |
| S222 | Summer II 2022 Enrollment Data | CSE, COGS, MATH, ECE undergraduate courses | [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/2022Summer2) |

Starting with FA22, enrollment and drop data will be integrated into one term folder. Additionally, graduate and undergraduate courses will be separated.

## Content
**This** repository simply contains a bunch of random scripts to help me clean up and process the enrollment data, documentation regarding how the CSV files are structured, and links to the sibling repositories. **Each sibling repository** contains CSV files which contains information regarding the number of seats available at some time for certain classes. There are also some scripts designed to help clean and analyze the data. Additionally, there are pre-generated plots of each course that is being tracked.

## Documentation
Below, you can find some documentation to get you started.
