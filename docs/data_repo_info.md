# Data Repository Structure
As mentioned earlier, this is the "parent" repository that "branches out" into multiple child repositories, known as data repositories.

In other words, this repository contains all the information you need to understand how everything works, while the data repositories simply contain the enrollment data. 

## Repository Structure
Every data repository is expected to contain the same layout; that is, you should not expect to see any significant differences between two data repositories in terms of what they look like.

### Required Files & Folders
Every data repository must have the following files and folders:

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| `raw` | Folder | A folder that contains the **raw** CSV files generated by my [scraper](https://github.com/ewang2002/webreg_scraper). |
| `cleaned` | Folder |  A folder containing one CSV file that consists of all CSV files merged together from `raw`. Due to size limitations, this file will _not_ be checked into Git; however, you're free to recreate it using the scripts provided. |
| `overall` | Folder |  A folder containing one CSV file per *course* (e.g. CSE 8A with 2 sections would both be put in a file called `CSE 8A.csv`). |
| `section` | Folder |  A folder containing one CSV file per *section* (e.g. CSE 8A with 2 sections `A` and `B` would be put in two files called `CSE 8A_A.csv` and `CSE 8A_B.csv`). |
| `plot_overall` | Folder |  A folder containing all of the graphs, where each graph was created using the data points from the CSV files found in the `overall` folder. |
| `plot_section` | Folder |  A folder containing all of the graphs, where each graph was created using the data points from the CSV files found in the `section` folder. |
| `plotconfig.txt` | File | A configuration file that lets you configure a few things regarding how the graphs should look. To see an example configuration file, click [here](https://github.com/ewang2002/UCSDHistEnrollData/blob/master/misc/config_examples/plotconfig2.txt). |
| `all_courses.txt` | File | A file containing a list of all courses whose data is in this repository. |
| `all_sections.txt` | File | A file containing a list of all sections whose data is in this repository. |
| `.gitignore` | File | [Basically, files that we aren't committing to GitHub](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). Some examples include the various scripts needed to process the raw CSV files (these are available in this repository). |

### Optional Files & Folders
Below are some of the optional files and folders; in other words, they may or may not exist. 

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| `plot_overall_wide` | Folder | A folder containing all of the graphs, where each graph was created using the data points from the CSV files found in the `overall` folder. Unlike `plot_overall`, graphs in this folder are significantly bigger. |
| `plot_section_wide` | Folder |  A folder containing all of the graphs, where each graph was created using the data points from the CSV files found in the `section` folder. Unlike `plot_section`, graphs in this folder are significantly bigger. |

## `plotconfig.txt` Configuration File
As implied, every term folder *must have* a `plotconfig.txt` file; this gives the `plot.py` script the configuration information needed to run properly. 

In the `misc/config_examples` directory of this project, there are two example files you can pick from.

| File | Information |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `plotconfig.txt` | The original configuration file. This is usually easier to work with, but doesn't allow for a lot of customization. |
| `plotconfig2.txt` | The second version of the configuration file. This configuration file is much longer and slightly more tedious to edit by default, but it gives you more control over how the plots should look (in particular, how the marker lines and regions look). **Note:** plotting 1st/2nd pass enrollment (`['sfsp', 'ofsp']`) is not possible with this version. |

`plot.py` supports both versions. Instructions on how you can use them can be found in the example files themselves, as comments. It is strongly recommended that you use the *second version* of the configuration file. **NOTE:** Be sure to rename the configuration file to `plotconfig.txt`.

Finally, the `plotconfig.txt` file has the same syntax as a regular Python file. If you'd like to validate that the file is syntatically correct, you can change the file's extension to `py` and then try to run it. Be sure to change the extension back to `txt` if you do this.
