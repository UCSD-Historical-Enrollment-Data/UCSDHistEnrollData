Prerequisites: upper-division standing.
ANTH	ANSC 188	Cultures of Healing	4	This course looks at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in contexts where they are not defined merely as physiological problems, but are seen as having important spiritual, aesthetic, and sociopolitical dimensions.

The course includes a workshop component where students will be encouraged to present material from their own research projects. Prerequisites: upper-division standing.
ANTH	ANSC 191GS	Everyday Life in South Asia: Beyond the Clichés	4	Popular representations of South Asia abound in clichés: poverty and luxury, cities and hamlets, ascetics and call centers.

ANTH	ANSC 193	Capitalism and Nature	4	This course explores the way that “capitalism,” understood as a combined economic, political, and cultural system, shapes features of the world that typically have been understood as “natural.” The course considers how these categorical distinctions affect our understandings of contemporary life and our chances to change it. Prerequisites: upper-division standing.
ANTH	ANSC 193GS	Human Rights and Environmental Justice	4	In this course, we will examine the dominant human rights framework to think about one issue that has escaped its purview: environmental justice.

VIS	VIS 120A	Greek Art	4	Greek classical civilization was a turning point in the history of humanity. Within a new kind of society, the idea of the individual as free and responsible was forged, and with it the invention of history, philosophy, tragedy, and science. The arts that expressed this cultural explosion were no less revolutionary. The achievements of Greek art in architecture, sculpture, and painting will be examined from their beginnings in the archaic period, to their epoch-making fulfillment in the classical decades of the fifth century BC, to their diffusion over the entire ancient world in the age of Alexander and his successors. Recommended preparation: VIS 20. Prerequisites: none.
VIS	VIS 120B	Roman Art	4	Roman art was the “modern art” of antiquity. Out of their Italic tradition and the great inheritance of Greek classic and Hellenistic art, the Romans forged a new language of form to meet the needs of a vast empire, a complex and tumultuous society, and a sophisticated, intellectually diverse culture. An unprecedented architecture of shaped space used new materials and revolutionary engineering techniques in boldly functional ways for purposes of psychological control and symbolic assertion. Sculpture in the round and in relief was pictorialized to gain spatial effects and immediacy of presence, and an extraordinary art of portraiture investigated the psychology while asserting the status claims of the individual. Extreme shifts of style, from the classicism of the age of Augustus to the expressionism of the third century AD, are characteristic of this period. The new modes of architecture, sculpture, and painting, whether in the service of the rhetoric of state power or of the individual quest for meaning, were passed on to the medieval and ultimately to the modern West. Recommended preparation: VIS 20. Prerequisites: none.
VIS	VIS 120C	Late Antique Art	4	During the later centuries of the Roman Empire, the ancient world underwent a profound crisis. Beset by barbarian invasions, torn by internal conflict and drastic social change, inflamed with religious passion that was to lead to a transformed vision of the individual, the world, and the divine, this momentous age saw the conversion of the Roman world to Christianity, the transfer of power from Rome to Constantinople, and the creation of a new society and culture. Out of this ferment, during the centuries from Constantine to Justinian, there emerged new art forms fit to represent the new vision of an otherworldly reality: a vaulted architecture of diaphanous space, a new art of mosaic, which dissolved surfaces in light, a figural language both abstractly symbolic and urgently expressive. The great creative epoch transformed the heritage of classical Greco-Roman art and laid the foundations of the art of the Christian West and Muslim East for the next thousand years. Recommended preparation: VIS 20 or 120B. Prerequisites: none.
VIS	VIS 121AN	Art and Experience in the Middle Ages	4	This survey course follows the parallel tracks of the sacred and secular in art and architecture from Constantine to the Crusades. Highlights include the emergence of Christian art, visual culture of the courts, development of monasteries, fall and rise of towns and cities, and arts of ritual. The thematic juxtaposition of different media and medieval people speaking in their own voices yields a multidimensional image of society in which the medieval experience is made as concrete as possible. Recommended preparation: VIS 20. Prerequisites: upper-division standing.
VIS	VIS 121B	Church and Mosque: Medieval Art and Architecture between Christianity and Islam	4	This course surveys the changes in art and architecture caused by the rise of new religions after the ancient world demise, a period of upheaval and contention often known as the “Clash of Gods.” How did Christianity come to dominate Europe with its churches and monasteries and then Islam with its mosques in the Middle East and North Africa? Studying the role of religion in the formation of artistic styles will show a dynamic interaction between the visual cultures of Christianity and Islam. Recommended preparation: VIS 20. Prerequisites: upper-division standing.
VIS	VIS 121H	Medieval Multiculturalism	4	This seminar explores movement and exchange between Mediterranean cities with diverse political, social, ethnic, and religious roots and the new modes of art, architecture, and intellectual discourse that this diversity fostered. In addition to medieval sources, readings include art historical and theoretical texts from a variety of periods and fields that frame the implications of multiculturalism for historical and contemporary categories of perception and for the analysis of visual culture. Recommended preparation: VIS 20 or VIS 112 recommended. Prerequisites: upper-division standing.

VIS	VIS 122D	Michelangelo	4	This course offers new approaches to understanding Michelangelo’s greatest creations. By considering how each work relates to the setting for which it was intended, by regarding critical literature and artistic borrowings as evidence about the works, and by studying the thought of the spiritual reformers who counseled Michelangelo, new interpretations emerge which show the artist to be a deeply religious man who invested his works with both public and private meanings.

VIS	VIS 123AN	Between Spirit and Flesh	4	The art of the Early Renaissance in Northern Europe is marked by what appears to be striking conflict: on the one hand, a new love of nature and the pleasures of court society, and on the other, an intensified spirituality and focus on personal devotion.
